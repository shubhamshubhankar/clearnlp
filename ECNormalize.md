# Empty Category Normalizer #

The co-indexes of empty categories in the original Penn Treebank are annotated on phrases.  In the following tree, `NP-1` contains an empty category `*` that is linked to `NP-SBJ-1` indicated by the co-index `1`.  On the other hand, gapping is represented by the `=` operation.  For example, `NP-SBJ=1-3` is an antecedent of the empty category `*` in `NP-3` indicated by the co-index `3`, and also has a gapping relation to `NP-SBJ-1` indicated by the gap-index `1`.

This annotation scheme can be confusing; the co-index in `NP-1` indicates that there is an empty category under this phrase whereas the co-index in `NP-SBJ-1` indicates that this phrase is an antecedent of some empty category.  To reduce the confusion, recent Treebanks (e.g., OntoNotes) start normalizing these empty categories so the co-indexes are annotated on the empty categories themselves (e.g., `*-1`; see the following tree).  This normalization is assumed for several NLP tools (e.g., a constituent-to-dependency converter), so it is important to check what kind of Treebank format your system requires.

## How to run ##

```
java com.googlecode.clearnlp.run.ECNormalize -i <filepath> -o <filepath> [-ie <regex>]

-i  <filepath> : the input path (input; required)
-o  <filepath> : the output path (output; required)
-ie <regex>    : the input file extension (default: .*)
```

  * The input path can point to either a file or a directory.  When the input path points to a file, only the specific file is processed.  When the input path points to a directory, all files with the input file extension (`-ie`) under the specific directory are processed.
  * If the input path points to a file, the output path must point to a file.  If the input path points to a directory, the output path must point to a directory, in which case, all outputs are saved in the output directory using the same file names in the input directory.
  * The input file extension can be either a string (e.g., `txt`) or a [regular expression](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) specifying the extension of input files.  The default value (`.*`) implies files with any extension.  This option is used only when the input path (`-i`) points to a directory.

The following command takes a sample input file ([ec-normalize-sample.txt](http://clearnlp.googlecode.com/git/src/main/resources/sample/ec-normalize-sample.txt)) and generates an output file ([ec-normalize-sample.out](http://clearnlp.googlecode.com/git/src/main/resources/sample/ec-normalize-sample.out)).

```
java com.googlecode.clearnlp.run.ECNormalize -i ec-normalize-sample.txt -o ec-normalize-sample.out
```
